In this repository we're controlling ***L298N motor drivers***, 

If you look at the "**Fritzing**" folder, you will find a Fritzing schematic drawing about **L298N** with an **Arduino UNO**

If you look at the "**L298N_Kontrol**" folder, you will find an **Arduino Code** to control **L298N**

If you look at the "**Button_Speed_Control**" folder, you will find an **Arduino Code** for "**Button controlled L298N**"

If you look at the "**Fritzing Button Input Arduino**" folder, you will find **Fritzing drawing of Button Input** on **Arduino UNO**




If you connect;

L298N Motor Driver's           **en1** pin            to             Arduino's **3rd** pin
L298N Motor Driver's           **en2** pin            to             Arduino's **4th** pin
L298N Motor Driver's           **in1** pin            to             Arduino's **5th** pin
L298N Motor Driver's           **in2** pin            to             Arduino's **6th** pin
L298N Motor Driver's           **in3** pin            to             Arduino's **7th** pin
L298N Motor Driver's           **in4** pin            to             Arduino's **9th** pin

    and
                                        
ONE BUTTON   (shift up)                           to             Arduino's 10th pin                                        
ONE BUTTON   (shift down)                         to             Arduino's 11st pin  


you can **UPLOAD** the    ***BUTTON SPEED CONTROL CODE***   to             ***YOUR ARDUINO*** MicroController
