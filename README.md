In this repository we're controlling ***L298N motor drivers***, 

If you look at the "**Fritzing**" folder, you will find a Fritzing schematic drawing about **L298N** with an **Arduino UNO**

If you look at the "**L298N_Kontrol**" folder, you will find an **Arduino Code** to control **L298N**

If you look at the "**Button_Speed_Control**" folder, you will find an **Arduino Code** for "**Button controlled L298N**"

If you look at the "**Fritzing Button Input Arduino**" folder, you will find **Fritzing drawing of Button Input** on **Arduino UNO**



## If you connect;


1. L298N Motor Driver's           **en1** pin            to             Arduino's **3rd** pin

2. L298N Motor Driver's           **en2** pin            to             Arduino's **4th** pin

3. L298N Motor Driver's           **in1** pin            to             Arduino's **5th** pin

4. L298N Motor Driver's           **in2** pin            to             Arduino's **6th** pin

5. L298N Motor Driver's           **in3** pin            to             Arduino's **7th** pin

6. L298N Motor Driver's           **in4** pin            to             Arduino's **9th** pin

and
                                        
7. ONE BUTTON   (shift up)                               to             Arduino's 10th pin                
 
7. ONE BUTTON   (shift down)                             to             Arduino's 11st pin  


you can **UPLOAD** the    ***BUTTON SPEED CONTROL CODE***   to             ***YOUR ARDUINO*** MicroController
